# 3D - RADNet
This repository is currently under development. The work presented in this repository is currently under consideration for the Medical Imaging and Deep Learning 2020 conference (MIDL 2020). The publication can be found in the [link here]( https://openreview.net/forum?id=CCbuElJreP).

## Introduction
**3D - RADNet** which stands for *extracting **R**adiological imaging **A**ttibutes from **D**ICOM headers network*, is a 3D convolution neural network 

## Requirements and Installations
- The testing data and the model's weights for this network can be downloaded from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12mjuS23pBy-KZTN3KNDJAlTxr2tttioX?usp=sharing).

We strongly recommend creating a seperate python or anaconda environments to test this.

## Examples
